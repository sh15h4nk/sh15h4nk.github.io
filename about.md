H3y th3r3!, I'm currently pursuing 2nd year of my CS degree, at [RGUKT](https://rguktn.ac.in/). I always prefer to write quality code, `but at the age of testing and experimenting I mostly care about the results`. I always try to leave my comfort zone, beacuse there is always some magic out there which continuously excites and pulls me towards. I prefer to learn game from the ground, but for a big match I start from classroom. I have no prefered language selection but part of me likes python, maybe because its the first language that I started learning, which gave me brief abstract about programming. Yes, I understood programming through a programming langauge. In conclusion I choose interation over recursion.
